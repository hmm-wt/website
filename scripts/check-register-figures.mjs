/* Guards the "enacted record" sentence in index.html against the data it describes.

   The sentence states six figures. They are correct today, but nothing stopped
   them drifting from data/reg_instruments.js, and a review of this site did in
   fact mis-read them once — by counting every `enforceable` row regardless of
   status, which sweeps in the four `expected` instruments the same sentence
   separately calls "four more scheduled". That definition is the whole point of
   this check, so it is written down here rather than left to be re-derived:

     IN FORCE   = in-market (not global), type "enforceable", status NOT "expected"
     SCHEDULED  = in-market, year 2027-2030

   Usage: node scripts/check-register-figures.mjs        (exit 1 on mismatch) */
