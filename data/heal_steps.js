// heal_steps.js - verbatim transcription of GP-authored HEAL content.
// TRANSCRIPTION ONLY: no paraphrase, no invention. Every named entity, statistic,
// regulation, and AI term preserved exactly as authored.
//
// CLOCK EDIT: the instructed replacement of "where the technology clock ticks" ->
// "where AI lands hardest" did NOT match any text in the source. The source phrase
// as supplied already reads "where AI lands hardest" (chart note; readoutLabel).
// No wording was changed. Nothing else edited.
//
// FLAGGED AMBIGUITY - the ai.action / ai.tense enums do not cleanly fit every step;
// the verbatim wording is preserved in ai.detail regardless. Judgement calls:
//   01: tense "Emerging-to-real" spans emerging->deployed -> mapped tense:"mixed".
//   03: no accelerate/open/erode verb stated -> action:"" ; "Emerging on design,
//       deployed on control" -> tense:"mixed".
//   05: no accelerate/open/erode verb stated -> action:"" ; "deployed and advancing"
//       vs RL "research-stage" -> tense:"mixed".
//   06: no accelerate/open/erode verb stated -> action:"" ; "Deployed to emerging" -> tense:"mixed".
//   07: no accelerate/open/erode verb stated -> action:"" ; "Emerging" -> tense:"emerging".
//   08: no accelerate/open/erode verb stated -> action:"" ; "Deployed to emerging" -> tense:"mixed".
//       Source names the layer "Perception and feedback"; "feedback" is not one of the
//       four named layers (perception|design|control|orchestration), so layers:["perception"]
//       and the "feedback" term is retained verbatim in ai.detail.

  definition: "Heal is the healthcare system underwritten from preventative care through to death: detecting biological disorder, intervening to reverse or slow it, and managing the arc to its end. It is a necessity because demand is universal, lifelong, and rising with age structure, rationed by capacity rather than want, and failure is counted in mortality. Its binding constraint is not thermodynamic but a regulatory and reimbursement throttle, and value migrates upstream to detection, where the cost of a returned life-year is lowest.",
  chartNote: "The chain of care is the necessity. The read-out at step 02 is where value concentrates and where AI lands hardest.",
  readoutLabel: "the read-out, where AI lands hardest",
  throughLine: "Read the three together and one lesson repeats. AI's leverage lands wherever the binding constraint is perception, design, or control, and in each system that is a specific layer: critical minerals in Power, biological inputs and field autonomy in Food, the diagnostic read-out in Health. In every case that same layer is where regulation binds hardest, because export control, GMO and machinery law, and device approval all sit exactly there. The co-location is the point. AI erodes moats everywhere it touches; the regulated gate is what stops that erosion from commoditising the winner. The chain is the necessity, AI decides which layer of it compounds, and regulation decides who keeps the compounding.",
