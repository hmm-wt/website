// TRANSCRIPTION of GP-authored POWER content. Verbatim; no paraphrase/invention.
// AMBIGUITY FLAGS:
//   - ai.action: steps 03, 04, 07, 08, 10 use NO accelerates/opens/erodes verb in the
//     source, so action is left "" for those (not fabricated). Steps with an explicit
//     verb: 01 accelerates, 02 accelerates ("accelerating"), 05 accelerates
//     ("Accelerates operations"), 06 opens ("opens rather than accelerates"),
//     09 accelerates ("accelerating").
//   - ai.tense "mixed" used where the source names both deployed and emerging
//     (03, 04, 05, 06, 08). Single-tense: 01/02 deployed, 07 emerging, 09 deployed, 10 emerging.

  definition: "Power is the energy system underwritten end to end: the physical chain that converts a raw natural resource into dispatchable work delivered to where the economy uses it, then recovers the durable material. It is a necessity because nothing in the economy runs without it, demand is price-inelastic and structurally rising, and failure is counted in blackouts and shuttered industry. Its binding constraints are storage and the critical minerals that feed every device.",
  chainNote: "The chain is the necessity. The materials layer beneath stages 02–06, closed by recovery at 10, is where the return concentrates.",
