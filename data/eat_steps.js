// eat_steps.js - Eat vertical: seed-to-mouth dual-chain (plant + animal) data
// Transcribed verbatim from GP-authored source. TRANSCRIPTION, not authoring.
//
// AMBIGUITY FLAGS:
// - Step id "10" in the numbered steps is "Nutrient recovery"; the chart's
//   `shared` array labels position 10 as "10 MOUTH". The source chart note and
//   the recovery line both describe nutrient recovery closing the loop opened at
//   step 01. Chart `shared` and `recovery` are captured separately per schema, so
//   the numbered step 10 = Nutrient recovery is kept as authored; "10 MOUTH" is
//   retained only inside chart.shared as the source's terminal-position label.
// - AI `action` verbs are inferred from source AI text per the accelerates/opens/
//   erodes lexicon: 01 "opens" (opens a new cost structure); 04 "accelerates"
//   (accelerates a thin-margin process). Where the source gives no such verb, the
//   field is set to "" rather than fabricated.
// - AI `tense` (deployed/emerging/promised) is read from explicit source words
//   ("deployed", "emerging"). Where a step mixes both (e.g. 01 emerging + already
//   deployed), tense="mixed". Steps stating only "Deployed" -> "deployed".

  definition: "Eat is the food and agricultural system underwritten from seed to mouth, spanning both crop and livestock production interlinked into one cycle. The plant chain captures the solar flux in biomass; the animal chain converts a share of that biomass, plus pasture and forage, into higher-value protein, dairy, and eggs; and nutrients cycle back to the soil through residue and manure. It is a necessity because demand is daily, non-deferrable, and rising on fixed arable land and finite water, and shortfalls surface as price shocks and instability. Its binding constraints are fixed nitrogen on the plant side and feed-conversion efficiency on the animal side, both of which are energy costs in disguise.",

  },

  interlink: "The plant and animal chains are not two industries; they are one loop. A large share of crop output leaves as feed, so the price of protein is downstream of the price of grain, which is downstream of the price of nitrogen, which is downstream of the price of gas. Manure closes the loop the other way, returning nitrogen and phosphorus to the soil and offsetting synthetic input. That is why Eat is underwritten as a single system from seed to mouth: break either chain and the other loses its feed or its fertility.",
